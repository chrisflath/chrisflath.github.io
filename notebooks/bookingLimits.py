    # Revenue Management: Static Booking Limits

    This notebook demonstrates a static booking limit model for revenue management, specifically for a hotel with two fare classes: high and low. The goal is to determine the optimal number of rooms to protect for the high fare class in order to maximize expected revenue.

    ## Model Description

    The model considers a hotel with a fixed number of rooms (`total_rooms`).  Rooms can be sold at either a high fare (`high_fare`) or a low fare (`low_fare`).  The demand for high fare rooms is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution with a mean of `mean_demand_high_fare`.

    The core idea is to protect a certain number of rooms (`protected_high_fare_rooms`) for potential high-fare customers.  If the actual demand for high-fare rooms exceeds this protection level, the excess demand is turned away (or, in this simplified model, assumed to be accommodated at the low fare).

    The booking limit for the low fare class is then implicitly determined as `total_rooms - protected_high_fare_rooms`.  This means we will sell no more than `total_rooms - protected_high_fare_rooms` low fare tickets because we are protecting `protected_high_fare_rooms` seats for high fare passengers.

    ## Parameters

    *   `total_rooms`: The total number of rooms available in the hotel.
    *   `low_fare`: The price of a low-fare room.
    *   `high_fare`: The price of a high-fare room.
    *   `mean_demand_high_fare`: The average demand for high-fare rooms (lambda parameter of the Poisson distribution).
    *   `protected_high_fare_rooms`: The number of rooms to protect for high-fare customers.  This is the decision variable we want to optimize.

    ## Expected Revenue Calculation

    The expected revenue is calculated by considering all possible demand scenarios for high-fare rooms (from 0 to `total_rooms`). For each scenario, we calculate the probability of that demand occurring (using the Poisson distribution) and the resulting revenue. The revenue is calculated as follows:

    *   If the high-fare demand is less than or equal to `protected_high_fare_rooms`, then all high-fare demand is accommodated at the high fare, and the remaining rooms are sold at the low fare.
    *   If the high-fare demand exceeds `protected_high_fare_rooms`, then only `protected_high_fare_rooms` are sold at the high fare, and the rest of the rooms are sold at the low fare.

    The expected revenue is the sum of the revenue for each scenario, weighted by the probability of that scenario.

    ## Optimization

    The goal is to find the value of `protected_high_fare_rooms` that maximizes the expected revenue.  This is done by calculating the expected revenue for all possible values of `protected_high_fare_rooms` (from 0 to `total_rooms`) and selecting the value that yields the highest expected revenue.

    ## Interactive Exploration

    Use the sliders below to adjust the parameters of the model and observe the impact on the expected revenue and the optimal number of protected high-fare rooms.
